- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hubert Bertling
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m retired and enjoy getting involved in the world of web development.
- I have developed a Sudoku trainer consisting of a solver, a generator and a puzzle database. 
  - The special feature of the solver is that you can watch it find the solution. 
  - Each numbering in a cell is justified and thus comprehensible.
  - The generator creates puzzles for all levels of difficulty, including unsolvable and ambiguous puzzles.
  - The aim of this trainer is not only to practice the application of logical inference rules, but also to provide
  - an overview of and deep insights in the whole 9x9-Sudoku space.
