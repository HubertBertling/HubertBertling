- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hubert Bertling
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m retired and enjoy getting involved in the world of web development.
- I have developed a Sudoku solver/generator. 
  - The special feature of this solver is that you can watch it find the solution. 
  - Each numbering in a cell is justified and thus comprehensible.
  - The generator produces puzzles that can be solved without backtracking. Simply by logical reasoning.
